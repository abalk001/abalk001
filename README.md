# Welcome to My GitHub Universe 

Hi there! I'm a computational physicist, software engineer, and mathematician-in-the-making. A true jack of all trades, thriving in chaos and constantly hungry for knowledge. My mind never shuts down—always exploring, always creating, always learning.

## About Me
- **Computational Physics**: Simulating the universe, one equation at a time.
- **Software Engineering**: Building tools to make life (and science) easier.
- **Mathematics**: Finding beauty in numbers and patterns.
- **Biology Projects**: Bridging the gap between life and computation.

I thrive in the intersection of disciplines, where chaos breeds creativity. If you're into solving complex problems, pushing boundaries, or just geeking out over cool ideas, you're in the right place!
